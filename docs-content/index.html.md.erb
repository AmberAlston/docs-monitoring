owner: PCF Metrics Platform Monitoring
---

This guide describes how Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) operators can monitor their deployments. 

##<a id="guide"></a> In This Guide

This guide includes the following topics: 

* <a class="subnav" href="./kpi.html">Key Performance Indicators</a>: A list of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that operators may want to monitor with their PCF deployment to help ensure it is in a good operational state.
* <a class="subnav" href="./key-cap-scaling.html">Key Capacity Scaling Indicators</a>: A list of capacity scaling indicators that operators may want to  monitor to determine when they need to scale their PCF deployments.
* <a class="subnav" href="./metrics.html">Configuring a Monitoring System</a>: Guidance for setting up PCF with third-party monitoring platforms to continuously monitor system metrics and trigger health alerts.

##<a id="new"></a> KPI Changes from PCF v1.10 to v1.11

This table highlights new and changed KPIs in PCF v1.11.

  <tr>
    <td><em>New</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>scalablesyslog.adapter.dropped</code></strong><br><br>
    New component functionality within the Firehose system adds the need for additional performance monitoring considerations. Derived into a Loss Rate along with new metric <code>scalablesyslog.adapter.ingress</code></td>

   <tr>
    <td><em>Modified</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>auctioneer.AuctioneerFetchStatesDuration</code></strong><br><br>
         Continued improvements in underlying architecture led to the recommendation to tighten these thresholds. Yellow is now 2s (formerly 5s) and Red is now 5s (formerly 10s).</td>
    <td><a href="./kpi.html#AuctioneerFetchStatesDuration">Link</a></td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td><em>Modified</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>rep.RepBulkSyncDuration</code></strong><br><br>
         Continued improvements to the route emitter led to the recommendation to tighten the suggested starting threshold on this dynamic metric. Yellow is now 5s (formerly 10s) and Red is now 10s (formerly 20s).</td>
    <td><a href="./kpi.html#RepBulkSyncDuration">Link</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Modified</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>route_emitter.RouteEmitterSyncDuration</code></strong><br><br>

  <tr>
    <td><em>Replaced</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>NAME-OF-OBSOLETE-KPI</code></strong><br><br>
    This KPI has been replaced by <code>NAME-OF-NEW-KPI</code></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Deleted</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>route_emitter.ConsulDownMode</code></strong><br><br>
         This KPI was highly specific to monitoring for negative consul impacts that could result in application routes becoming unavailable. Continued improvements to the route emitter have now removed the consul dependency; there is no longer communication between route emitter and consul.</td>
    <td><em>n/a</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><em>Deleted</em></td>
    <td>KPI: <strong><code>nsync_bulker.DesiredLRPSyncDuration</code></strong><br><br>
         This metric is no longer relevant with the related architectural changes to secure Cloud Controller to Diego communication. There is not yet an equivalent metric within the new architecture, but additional monitoring metrics for this modified architecture will be added in upcoming releases.</td>
    <td><em>n/a</em></td>
