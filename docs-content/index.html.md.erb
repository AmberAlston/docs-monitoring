This guide describes how Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) operators can monitor their deployments. 

##<a id="guide"></a> In This Guide

This guide includes the following topics: 

* <a class="subnav" href="./kpi.html">Key Performance Indicators</a>: A list of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that operators may want to monitor with their PCF deployment to help ensure it is in a good operational state.
* <a class="subnav" href="./key-cap-scaling.html">Key Capacity Scaling Indicators</a>: A list of capacity scaling indicators that operators may want to  monitor to determine when they need to scale their PCF deployments.
* <a class="subnav" href="./metrics.html">Selecting and Configuring a Monitoring System</a>: Guidance for setting up PCF with monitoring platforms to continuously monitor component metrics and trigger health alerts.

For information about logging and metrics in PCF and about monitoring of services for PCF, see <a href="#resources">Additional Resources</a> below.
